## FAQ

**Q: Does this work with ATEM, TriCaster, OBS Studio and others?**
A: Yes, however [Tally Arbiter](https://github.com/josephdadams/TallyArbiter) is required for this functionality. The plan is to integrate seemless with TA. Stay tuned for updates.

## Easiest install method

I've created a simple website that will allow you to easily flash your sticks. 
NOTE: This tool only works on Chromium Based browsers.

1. Select the version of the firmware
2. Select your stick
3. Click install, a device selection window will popup
4. Connect your stick and see which COM-port is added to the list.
5. Select that added COM-port and click OK
6. Wait for the flash process to finish
7. Once done, restart the stick (Hold the on/off button for 6 seconds, after that press it again to turn it on)
8. Enjoy ðŸ˜„

## Harder (and outdated) install method: Uploading the code to the stick

### Video tutorial

[![Video Tutoral](http://img.youtube.com/vi/uB_OkMGLoto/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB_OkMGLoto "How to update the firmware of the M5Stick C to the Tally Light project")

### Step 1

1.1 Follow the tutorial on the [M5Stack website](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/arduino/arduino_ide).

1.2 Copy the libraries that are used by this project (found in the `libs` folder) to your system. The default path is: `%userprofile%\Documents\Arduino\libraries`

### Step 2

Upload to your device.

##### When using the original M5Stick-C

You don't have to change the code! ðŸŽ‰

##### When using M5Stick-C PLUS

Change the very first line in `a_GLOBAL.ino` to `#define C_PLUS 1` (change the `0` to a `1`)
That's it!

### Step 3

Follow the instructions on the LCD.

### Step 4

Enjoy ðŸ˜„

## Configuring the stick

1. Once the code is uploaded to the stick, wait until it's in AP (Access Point) mode.
2. Grab a phone and connect to the `vMix-M5Stick-Tally` wifi network, the password is: `12345678`.
3. Open your browser and go to: `http://192.168.4.1`, this will open up the Web UI.
    1. Enter the SSID of the wifi network you want to connect to.
    2. Enter the password that corresponds to the SSID.
    3. Enter the IP Address of the PC that's running vMix.
    4. Specify the input number that the stick must listen to. (This is the little number in the top left corner of every input)
4. Hit the save button.
5. The stick will restart with the given information.

### Fields explained
**SSID**

A select dropdown which shows a list all the wifi networks found.

**Hidden SSID Name**

This field only shows when you select `Hidden network` in the SSID list. 
Type in the SSID that you want to connect to.

**Password**

The password that corresponds to the selected wifi network.

**vMix IP Address**

Fill in the IP Address of the computer where vMix is running. 

How to find the IP of the vMix PC:
1. Press Win + R
2. Type in `cmd` and hit enter. A commandprompt will appear
3. In the commandprompt type `ipconfig` and press enter
4. Your IP Address can be found behind the `IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : ` line

**Main Tally Number**

This field corresponds to the input number in vMix. Every input has a number in the top left corner of the video tile. Enter the input number you want the tally to respond to.

**Multi Input**

It's possible to have more inputs hooked into 1 tally light, you can provide a comma separated string to set this up.

Example: 

When the Main Tally Number is set to `1` and Multi Input is set to `2,5`, this will be the behavior:

SAFE:

None of the inputs are in Preview or in the Program feed.

PRE:

One of the inputs is in Preview, none are on Program.

LIVE:

One of the inputs is on the Program feed. Live always has the highest priority.

**Reconnect interval**

Input is in seconds. This will try to reconnect to vMix every `x` seconds after the interval has passed when it's disconnected. This will loop if the connection cannot be established. 

WARNING:
Since the stick is single threaded, when the stick tries to reconnect to vMix, the Web UI is not accessible! 

Example:
When set to `10` it will try to reconnect to vMix every 10 seconds after connection was unsuccessful.

**Brightness**

Set the brightness of the LCD. Option to choose from:
* 0%
* 20%
* 40%
* 60%
* 80%
* 100%

NOTE: Obviously, the battery will drain faster when the brightness is set to a high value. I recommend setting it at 60%.

**Just Live**

`true`: The stick only lights up when the configured input(s) is/are live.

`false`: The stick shows when the configured input(s) is/are safe, are in preview or when it is live.

**Mode**

`Text (SAFE, PRE, LIVE)`: Show the textual representation of the status of the configured input(s).

`Tally Number`: Show the configured main tally number and only update the background color when the status changes.

## Static IP Address

**WARNING**: This is only for users that know what they're doing. If you are not familiar with ip addresses, gateways or subnets, stay away.

It is possible to have a static IP Address, however it's not possible (yet) to do this via the Web UI. You need to hard-code this. A template is provided, but you'll have to change some code:

-   Open `e_WIFI.ino`
-   Remove the lines that have `REMOVE THIS LINE WHEN YOU NEED STATIC IP` in them (be sure to also remove the comment markers `/*` and `*/`)
-   Change the settings after the `IPAddress` lines that meet your needs in your environment.
